Calm, Shallow Sea
================

### A Responsive Octopress theme

Here is how it looks on the desktop:

![Calm, Shallow Sea - Desktop](/calm-shallow-imac.png)

It switches to a single column on smaller devices, and has a cool side menu thing:

<span style="float: right; display: inline-block; padding-right: 20px;">
![Calm, Shallow Sea - Phone](/calm-shallow-iphone.png)
</span>

Feel free to ask me any questions you have on twitter @alexharris6, or open an issue if you notice anything broken.

Install
-------
    $ cd octopress
    $ git clone git://github.com/alexharris/calm-shallow-sea.git .themes/calm-shallow-sea
    $ rake install['calm-shallow-sea']
    $ rake generate

Please note there are a few errors, mostly from Sass, when you `rake generate`. As far as I can tell, these do not result in any actual problems with the theme, but please let me know if you find out otherwise (or know how to get these errors resolved).
